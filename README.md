## About
Runs on a smart contract at address 0x03348dd5ef4a94f27b17551c3beebaf9c559dcc6.  You can view its activity on [Etherscan.io](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x03348dd5ef4a94f27b17551c3beebaf9c559dcc6).  Just send it some test ether and see how it goes.

### Improvements
1. Currently, the contract is only triggered when a call is made to it, so it may pay out late.
