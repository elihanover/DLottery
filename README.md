# DLottery
### Ethereum-based decentralized lottery (for learning purposes).  Any feedback and advice appreciated.

#### Next:
- Randomness in Solidity
  - Using ____ as a stand-in until better solution
- Handling events and timing
  - Now uses dapp calls to check whether it should close last lottery, but we want this to work independently ideally.
- User voting on lottery parameters
- What if you intend to buy tickets in auction n and it ends up in auction n+1?
