# DLottery
### Ethereum-based decentralized lottery (for learning purposes).  Any feedback and advice appreciated.

#### Next:
- Need to check whether funds match the buy tickets parameter
- Use updating browser events to update the lottery
- Randomness in Solidity
  - Using block hashes as a stand-in until better solution
- Handling events and timing
  - Uses dapp calls to check whether it should close last lottery, but we want this to work independently ideally.
- User voting on lottery parameters
- Atomicity
